## **1. Project Overview**

The Wine App is a mobile-first application designed for wine enthusiasts like "Jenny" to seamlessly discover, document, manage, and enjoy their wine experiences. Users can scan wine labels or search by text to retrieve detailed wine information, leveraging external data sources like Wine Searcher—and, if unavailable, fall back to LLM-based (e.g., Gemini) data generation. The app helps users record tasting notes, manage personal wine cellars (including purchases, consumption, and value), create wishlists, and receive personalized recommendations via an AI chat feature.

The goal is to provide an intuitive, centralized platform for all wine-related activities. Success is measured by user engagement, user growth, accuracy of wine information, and overall satisfaction.

## **2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope**

### **In-Scope**

1. **User Authentication**: 
   * Secure login/signup via Email, Google, Apple through Supabase Auth
   * Users can skip sign-in initially but must sign in for save actions (adding to cellar, taking notes, etc.)

2. **Wine Search & Discovery**:
   * Text or image (label) search
   * Primary data from Wine Searcher; fallback to LLM-generated data if Wine Searcher is down
   * Single vs. multiple results handling
   * **Implementation Note**: Detailed implementation requires clarification before proceeding

3. **Wine Card**:
   * Comprehensive wine details (Vintage, Name, Region, Winery, Grapes) plus AI insights (Food Pairing, Drinking Window)
   * Cached Price/Offers data
   * Primary user actions: Add to Wishlist, Add to Cellar, Tasting Notes, Consumption

4. **Consumption** (Separate Feature):
   * Users can record consumption of any wine, whether it's in their cellar or not
   * If the wine is also present in the user's cellar, the app asks if they want to decrement the cellar quantity
   * Backend API will be updated to support consuming wines not in cellar

5. **Cellar Management**:
   * Users can create multiple named cellars
   * Each cellar can have multiple sections
   * Adding wines (always tracking vintage)
   * Sorting/organizing bottles by region, variety, vintage, etc.
   * Basic cellar reports (inventory count, region/vintage breakdown, total investment)

6. **Tasting Notes**:
   * Simple note format: Free-text notes with a 5-star rating (supporting fractional ratings)
   * Photo uploads
   * **P1 Feature**: Pro Version (WSET 3) with structured fields (Appearance, Nose, Palate, Conclusion)

7. **AI Chat** (P1):
   * Conversational AI for recommendations, pairings, etc.
   * Pulls context from user data (searches, cellar, notes, wishlist)
   * **Implementation Note**: Detailed AI integration requires clarification before proceeding

8. **My Wines Hub**:
   * Central access point for user's Cellar, Wishlist, Tasting Notes, and Wine Journal

9. **Wine Journal**:
   * For initial implementation, only include scanned wines activities
   * Future expansion to include all user interactions (notes added, cellar additions, consumption events)

10. **Mobile-First Design**:
    * React Native app with a user-friendly, responsive interface
    * Bottom tab navigation for main sections (not drawer navigation)

### **Out-of-Scope**

* **In-App Purchasing/E-commerce**: The app surfaces offers but does not process payments
* **Advanced Social Networking**: No friend systems or extensive activity feeds
* **Offline Mode**: Active internet is required for core features
* **Integration with Smart Wine Fridges**: Beyond label scanning, no direct hardware support
* **Advanced Chemical Analysis**: Focus remains on standard wine data, tasting notes, and metadata
* **Advanced Cellar Reporting**: Only basic P1-level reporting is included
* **Cellar Sharing/Collaboration**: Potential P2 feature
* **Tasting Note Sharing**: Not currently part of this version

## **3. User Flow**

1. **Onboarding & Authentication**:
   * When a first-time user opens the Wine App, a brief series of onboarding screens introduces key features
   * Users can skip sign-in initially to explore the app anonymously
   * Sign-in prompt appears when trying to save data (add to cellar, take notes, etc.)
   * Login options: Email, Google, Apple (via Supabase Auth)

2. **Home Screen**:
   * Central interface with search bar (text) or label scanning feature
   * Navigation tabs at the bottom for Home, My Wines, Chat, and Profile

3. **Search**:
   * If one wine is found, go directly to its Wine Card
   * If multiple matches, display a Wine List to choose from
   * User can select any wine from the list to view its Wine Card
   * If Wine Searcher is down, provide LLM-based wine data
   * If label is ambiguous, prompt the user for more info or re-scan

4. **Wine Card**:
   * Displays wine details and AI insights
   * Actions: Add to Wishlist, Add to Cellar, Tasting Notes, Consume

5. **Consumption**:
   * Initiated from the Wine Card (even if the wine is not in a cellar)
   * If the wine is in the user's cellar, the app prompts user to decrement quantity

6. **My Wines**:
   * Central hub to manage Cellar, Wishlist, Tasting Notes, and the Wine Journal
   * Shows multiple cellars if user has created them

7. **Chat**:
   * AI-based recommendations or Q&A about wines

8. **Profile**:
   * Account settings, preferences, user info

## **4. Core Features**

### **Wine Search & Information Extraction**

3. Add context-awareness to chat functionality

### **Phase 7: Testing & Refinement**
1. Conduct user testing
2. Fix bugs and improve UX
3. Performance optimization

## **10. Database Optimization**

### **Table Consolidation Approach**

We have consolidated the database schema by:

1. **Simplifying `user_wines`**:
   - Removed `last_scan_date` as this information is now in the activities table
   - Focused solely on wishlist functionality

2. **Merging `user_scans` into an enhanced `user_activities` table**:
   - Single table for all user activities including scans
   - Direct foreign keys to related entities (wines, cellars) for easier querying
   - Added `file_url` field specifically for scan activities
   - Using `metadata` JSONB field for activity-specific data

### **Activity Types with Sample Metadata**

1. **scan**
   ```json
   {
     "recognized_count": 3,
     "recognized_wines": [
       {"wine_id": "uuid1", "confidence": 0.95, "name": "Château Margaux 2015"},
       {"wine_id": "uuid2", "confidence": 0.85, "name": "Château Lafite 2015"}
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **add_to_cellar**
   ```json
   {
     "quantity": 2,
     "purchase_price": 45.99,
     "section": "Rack A"
   }
   ```

3. **consume**
   ```json
   {
     "quantity": 1,
     "from_cellar": true,
     "occasion": "Anniversary dinner" 
   }
   ```

4. **note**
   ```json
   {
     "note_id": "uuid",
     "rating": 4.5,
     "summary": "Excellent balance and structure"
   }
   ```

5. **wishlist_add** / **wishlist_remove**
   ```json
   {
     "reason": "Recommended by friend"
   }
   ```

### **Benefits of This Approach**

1. **Simplified Schema**: Reduced from 3 tables to 2
2. **Improved Query Performance**: Direct foreign keys to related entities
3. **Greater Flexibility**: The metadata JSONB field handles activity-specific details
4. **Easier Reporting**: Single source of truth for the Wine Journal
5. **Cleaner Wine-User Relationship**: `user_wines` focuses solely on wishlist functionality
6. **Data consistency**: Less redundancy means fewer opportunities for data inconsistencies

## **11. User-Scanned Wine Images**

### **Implementation Strategy**

#### **1. Wine Images API Endpoint**

```python
@router.get("/wines/{wine_id}/images")
async def get_wine_images(
    wine_id: uuid.UUID,
    current_user_id: uuid.UUID = Depends(get_current_user_id)
):
    # First, check if this user has any scanned images for this wine
    user_scans = await db.fetch_all(
        """
        SELECT file_url, created_at
        FROM user_activities 
        WHERE user_id = :user_id 
        AND wine_id = :wine_id 
        AND activity_type = 'scan'
        AND file_url IS NOT NULL
        ORDER BY created_at DESC
        LIMIT 1
        """,
        {"user_id": current_user_id, "wine_id": wine_id}
    )
    
    # If user has scanned this wine, return their most recent scan image
    if user_scans and len(user_scans) > 0 and user_scans[0]["file_url"]:
        return {
            "image_url": user_scans[0]["file_url"],
            "is_user_scan": True,
            "scan_date": user_scans[0]["created_at"]
        }
    
    # Otherwise, return the default wine image from the wines table
    wine = await db.fetch_one(
        "SELECT image_url FROM wines WHERE id = :wine_id",
        {"wine_id": wine_id}
    )
    
    return {
        "image_url": wine["image_url"] if wine and wine["image_url"] else None,
        "is_user_scan": False
    }
```

#### **2. Wine Card Component**

```typescript
// WineCardScreen.tsx

        setWineImage(imageData);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Failed to load wine images:', error);
      }
    };
    
    loadWineImages();
  }, [wineId]);
  
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Card>

                Your scan from {new Date(wineImage.scanDate).toLocaleDateString()}
              </Text>
            )}
          </View>
        ) : (
          <View style={styles.placeholderImage}>
            <Text>No image available</Text>
          </View>
        )}
        
        <Card.Content>
          <Title>{wine?.name}</Title>
          <Paragraph>{wine?.vintage} • {wine?.region}</Paragraph>
          {/* Rest of wine details */}

  userScanBadge: {
    position: 'absolute',
    bottom: 8,
    right: 8,
    backgroundColor: 'rgba(0,0,0,0.6)',
    color: 'white',
    padding: 4,
    borderRadius: 4,
    fontSize: 12,
  },
});
```

#### **3. Recording Scan Activities**

```typescript
// ScanResultsScreen.tsx
const selectWine = async (recognizedWine) => {
  try {
    // Record the selected wine and associate it with the scan image
    await api.post('/activities', {
      activity_type: 'scan',
      wine_id: recognizedWine.id,
      file_url: scanImageUrl, // URL of uploaded scan image
      metadata: {
        recognized_count: recognizedWines.length,
        selected_from_multiple: recognizedWines.length > 1,
        confidence: recognizedWine.confidence
      }
    });
    
    // Navigate to the Wine Card
    navigation.navigate('WineCard', { wineId: recognizedWine.id });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to record wine selection:', error);
  }
};
```

#### **4. Implementation Considerations**

1. **Storage Management**: Implement proper policies for storing and potentially compressing user-scanned images in Supabase Storage

2. **Privacy & Permissions**: Ensure you have appropriate permissions to store and use the user's images

3. **Performance**: Consider caching frequently accessed images to improve load times

4. **UI Feedback**: Clearly indicate when displaying the user's own scanned image vs an official image

5. **Image Quality**: Provide a way for users to retake/replace low-quality scanned images

By implementing this approach, the Wine Card will display the user's own scanned images of wines when available, creating a more personalized and engaging experience.
