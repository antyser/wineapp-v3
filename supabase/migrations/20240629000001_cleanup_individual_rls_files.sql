-- This migration doesn't actually do anything but serves as documentation
-- The following individual RLS policy migrations have been consolidated into 20240629000000_consolidated_rls_policies.sql:
-- - 20240628000001_create_interactions_rls.sql
-- - 20240628000004_create_notes_rls.sql
-- - 20240628000005_create_cellars_rls.sql

-- If running migrations for the first time, both files will be applied, but the earlier policies
-- will be replaced by the consolidated policies (no error, as CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS is idempotent).
--
-- If you're maintaining this project and need to modify these policies, please do so in the consolidated file.
